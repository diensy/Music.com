            Stress relief and relaxation: A good movie, funny book, or engaging
            video game can take our minds off worries and anxieties. Laughter,
            especially, is a great stress reliever and can boost our mood.
            Boosts creativity and imagination: Entertainment can expose us to
            new ideas, worlds, and ways of thinking.
